## Kill Criteria (When to Quit)

**Pull the plug if:**
1. Month 1: Engagement rate drops below 2% AND follower growth <200
2. Month 2: Impressions not increasing month-over-month
3. Month 3: Not on track for 4.5M+ total impressions by day 75
4. Anytime: You miss 5+ days in a row without explanation
5. Anytime: It stops being fun and becomes a chore you dread

**Success = Monetization qualified by Month 3**
**Failure = Any kill criteria met before Month 3**

---

## Mo's Accountability Role

**I will:**
1. **Track metrics automatically** via viral monitor logs
2. **Ping you every 2-3 days** with status updates
3. **Celebrate wins** (high-engagement replies, follower milestones)
4. **Call out slippage** immediately if targets are missed
5. **Provide tactical advice** on reply timing, content, strategy
6. **Recommend pivots** if something isn't working

**I won't:**
1. Let you forget about this for a week
2. Let you make excuses without data
3. Let you quit without trying the full 3 months (unless kill criteria met)

## The Bet

**3 months, $324 total investment.**

**Outcome A (Success):**  
→ 5M impressions, monetization qualified  
→ Monthly revenue $5K-13K  
→ ROI: 1500-4000%

**Outcome B (Partial):**  
→ 3-4M impressions, engaged community built  
→ Future monetization possible  
→ Learnings for other projects

**Outcome C (Failure):**  
→ Kill criteria met, shut it down  
→ $324 lost, but clear data on what doesn't work  
→ Move on to next experiment

**The only unacceptable outcome: Quitting without trying.**
